<h1>History / история</h1>
<p>Bauman University is the second oldest educational institution in Russia after Lomonosov Moscow State University (1755). In 1763, the Russian empress Catherine II founded the Educational Imperial House. On 5 October 1826 the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna issued a decree to establish «great workshops for different crafts with bedrooms, a dining room, etc.» as a part of the Moscow Foundling Home in the German Quarter. All craft pupils were moved from the Orphanage there. On 1 July 1830 Emperor Nicholas I approved «Statute of Moscow Craft School». It was the inception of the first Russian technical university.
<br><br>
Russia's developing industry needed skilled labor in many trades. So, the aim of the new school was to train skillful artisans with a solid theoretical background to improve and spread skills in various trades all over Russia. New school was created to teach various crafts as well as basic sciences. By 1868 education became so good that MCS was reorganised into the Imperial Moscow Technical School (IMTS) under the directorship of Victor Della-Vos. The main purpose of IMTS was to «educate construction engineers, mechanical engineers and industrial technologists». IMTS achieved outstanding results in technology, chemical, food and textile industry, metal and wood treatment, and mechanical sciences.
<br><br>
The IMTS was financially supported by the Government and industrialists. Its management was democratic. But a key feature of the new institution was its educational system called the "Russian method",[5] which unifies a broad and intensive theoretical preparation with a deep practical education closely connected with industries. Under his leadership the school participated in the Universal Exposition in 1873 in Vienna and the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition of 1876, where this method won a gold prize. It proved to be influential on John Daniel Runkle when he introduced manual training alongside theoretical training at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[6] It was also applied to other American technical universities.[7] IMTS was recognized the best machine-building education institution of Russia and joined the ranks of the world leading polytechnic schools. A lot of outstanding scientists taught in IMTS, such as D. Mendeleev, N. Jukovsky, P. Chebychev, S. Chaplygin, A. Yershov, D. Sovetkin, F. Dmitriev, A. Letnikov, A. Gavrilenko.
<br><br>
In the Soviet period it was renamed Bauman Moscow Higher Technical School (BMHTS), after revolutionary Nikolay Bauman. BMHTS continued education of engineers for machine and instrument building. In 1938, new military departments were created in MHTS: tank, artillery, and ammunition. In 1948, rocket department was added.
<br><br>
During the first half of the 20th century, Bauman University formed and founded more than 70 technical universities in the USSR. Some of them are now well known institutions, such as Moscow Aviation Institute, Moscow Power Engineering Institute, Moscow University of Civil Engineering, Moscow Chemical Institute, Moscow Communication and Informatics University, Central Aerohydrodynamics Institute TSAGI, and the Military Academy of Aviation Engineering Joukovski.[8]
<br><br>
On 27 July 1989 USSR State committee for peoples education conferred on Moscow Higher Technical School a name of Bauman Moscow Technical University (BMSTU). BMSTU was honored to be the first Russian technical university. Nearly 200,000 students graduated from the University. Most of them chose to become scientists or engineers in leading research centers, universities, private and government owned companies. Many of government officials, chief designers, CEOs of big enterprises, and cosmonauts are Bauman graduates.
<br><br>
Many Bauman University graduates are world-renowned: Sergei Korolev for the first satellite in space and first man and woman in space, Andrey Tupolev for the world first supersonic passenger plane, Nikolay Dollezhal for the world first civil nuclear plant, Vladimir Shukhov for the first method and the world first petrol cracking plant as well as for the first hyperboloid structures in architecture, Nikolay Zhukovsky for the foundation of aerodynamics and hydrodynamics sciences, Pavel Sukhoi for the foundation of Sukhoi Aerospace Design Bureau. Some of the specialized departments of BMSTU are located outside Moscow in cities of Moscow Oblast: Krasnogorsk (Russian: Красногорск), Reutov (Russian: Реутов), Korolyov (Russian: Королёв). There is also a large branch of the University in Kaluga (Russian: Калуга).</p>
